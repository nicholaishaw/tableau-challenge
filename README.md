# Tableau Bike Analysis

## Background
In a fictional world, I have been tasked with overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States as a lead analyst for a [New York City bike program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike) (Citi Bike). In my new role, I will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

While the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so my first task on the job is to build a set of data reports using Tableau to provide the answers.
